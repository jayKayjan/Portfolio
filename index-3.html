									<h3 class="blog_head color1"><a href="#">My experience throughout the coding course</a></h3>
									<p id ="colors">If I could describe the feeling I had when entering the campus  on my first day I would describe it as an intense turmoil of emotions that I experienced all at once. It felt as though time stood still as anxiety, excitement, happiness and nervousness came crashing upon me. I remember observing the trees and the brick building all of which will become my surroundings for the duration of six months as I will be learning how to code at this place.</p>
									<p id ="colors">As someone who had no prior skills in coding,I found that learning Python which is an interactive scripting language, was exceptionally beneficial, as it set the basis for my coding knowledge. The syntax is structured in a simple way and easily readable, which allows one to pick up the language quickly. Within a few weeks I learned tremendously about loops, strings, lists ,dictionaries and if else statememts to mention a few. I was able to create algorithm that does calculations , asks the user's input,prints strings and so much more using code.Some tasks were more daunting than others, and researching and YouTube videos were a few of the resources which I made use from. </p> <br>

									<p id ="colors">After Python came module 2 which was Web Developement essentials. We started with html and it was exciting to see what a true webpage looked like designed with only a few blocks of code. I used css as a creative outlet as it allowed me to play around with different themes.I never knew exactly how indecisive I was until I had to choose between so many colours, types of fonts, and images. It was through this that I came to realise just how important wireframes are in helping one to see the final  product before actually creating it.This was especially important when faced with the implementation of more complexed tasks that required me to build websites for stores, and resumes, tasks which I was faced with in a later stage in the programme. Javascript which is a dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, provides interactivity on websites was what we learned thereafter. I came to enjoy the extreme functionality and flexibilty of the language as one could use it to create responses when buttons are pressed or data is entered in forms, it could even be used for animations and styling. A few of the tasks required me to use Javascript to create functions to convert currencies, drop down menus and alerts to mention a few. </p><br>


									<p id ="colors">Module 3 consisted of Web Development using React and Express.React which is a library for building composable user interfaces uses components to do so.In the weeks that passed I learned how to fetch API's , how to use  components to create calculators, using props,values and so forth. Thereafter I was introduced to Node.js which allows one to run JavaScript on a web server. We were also given a brief introduction into how to test our code. After that I had to work with Express which allows one to build back end applications and to handle routing as well as HTTP reaquests.After this our task required us to build  full stack web applications such as the one we had to create which interfaces with the iTunes Search API.</p><br>


									<p id = "colors">Overall I learned a lot throughout the course, and it was truly an incredible experience to be able to create programmes that work a certain way all because of code that has been generated to do so. Not only was I given insight into code, but also into self awareness and developement through the Life Skills and Self Developement sessions that were offered. I learned most  importantly that one should always keep calm when faced with a challenge and when you are willing to learn things the task at hand will seem simpler.finding ways such as listening to music or spending time in nature really helps to release pressure and to relax.Not only did I enjoy the actual course, but also that fact that I got to communicate and interact with so many people who were also there learning how to code. </p>
